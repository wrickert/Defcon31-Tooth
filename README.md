# DEFCON 31 SAO Template Repository

Welcome to the **DEFCON 31 Shitty Add On (SAO) Template Repository**! This repository serves as a starting point and resource hub for participants of DEFCON 31's Shitty Add On project. SAO stands for *"Shitty Add On,"* an exciting initiative that invites individuals to unleash their creativity and design unconventional and humorous add-ons for DEFCON badges.

To get started, check out the Hackaday article [Introducing the Shitty Add-On v1.69bis Standard](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/20/introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v1-69bis-standard) to learn more about the SAO project and get inspired by previous creations.

In addition, DEFCON 31 provides a detailed [PDF guide](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2031/DEF%20CON%2031%20badge/Badge%20Add-On.pdf) that offers comprehensive instructions, specifications, and guidelines for creating and integrating SAOs into DEFCON 31 badges. This guide will be your go-to resource for understanding the technical aspects of building SAOs.

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository, which includes a variety of templates, examples, and resources to assist you in developing your SAO. We encourage you to customize and expand upon these materials to create your own unique and captivating add-ons.
